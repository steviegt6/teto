Find the number corresponding to the NPC here: `https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Vanilla-Content-IDs#npc-ids` (Example: QueenBee: 222)\n2. Open up NPC.cs of your decompiled terraria, and search for `type == typeNumber` (Example: type == 222), and find the section of the code that declares width, height, damage etc, including aiStyle (Example: aiStyle = 43)\n3. In NPC.cs, search for `aiStyle == aiNumber` (Example: aiStyle == 43)\n4. Most of the time, there is only one result, which then leads to the code block responsible for the AI. You can check if you found the correct place if you have outlining enabled in Visual Studio, your found place should be in `VanillaAI()`\n5. Sometimes, multiple NPCs use the same aiStyle, to exclude those NPCs you don't want the AI for, look for boolean expressions in that aiStyle code containing `type` and the `typeNumber` of your NPC of interest, or the others (!=, <=, >=, ==, be careful not to accidently delete code related to the type you try to clone)\nFor a more thorough explanation, and how to setup decompiled Terraria, visit `https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Advanced-Vanilla-Code-Adaption`",

Said issues have been falsely blamed on other mods by official calamity developers. They have often taken a while to have a patch. While this has improved in recent months, It's worth pointing out if you want to be sure to avoid issues.\nPatreon: Calamity developers will implement fan suggestions if the fan provides money via Patreon & the suggestion is in reason. This is not inherently bad but some people may take issue with a lack of control over their own mod.\nLore: Calamity has a strong focus on lore, this is a massive contrast to the base-game & the quality of its implementation is up for discussion.\nSelf Insert: Calamity contains a Town NPC which is a direct representation of the creator of the mod. She sells alcohol & has 4th wall breaking dialog that contains adult humor.\nVisual Design: The artstyle and visual design is notably different from a majority of the base-game content, to the extent that they are working on a texture pack to recreate the base-game with their new artstyle in mind.\nUnoriginal Content:  Mechanics & items are blatantly taken from other media. Examples of games Calamity takes from are Subnautica, Hollow Knight, MGS:Revengence & Destiny. this content has been modified to fit Terraria.\nBalance: Balance of enemies, equipment & weapons in Calamity are designed to scale up notably faster than the base-game, and a majority of mods that base their progression on the base-game. This can make a majority of Calamity's content overshadow other mods, as their weapons are stronger in comparison & bosses more difficult to beat when using non-Calamity content.\nPerformance: Calamity can be very intense on low end PC's, due to large ram usage & an abundance of dust & projectile usage, This can force most players to require more than 4GB of ram via 64bit TML.",

This makes it so we don't need to add any extra logic for handling unequiping our accessory\n- Finally, we can implement any effect we want using any hooks on `SomeAccessoryPlayer`\n\nHere's an example of this pattern in action:\nAccessory: <https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/stable/ExampleMod/Content/Items/Accessories/ExampleImmunityAccessory.cs>\nPlayer: <https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/stable/ExampleMod/Common/Players/ExampleImmunityPlayer.cs>",

With tModLoader being updated every month, this won't produce reliably up to date code\n- ChatGPT is often confidently wrong, claiming one thing while the code does another or missing potential bugs. This might be obvious to more experienced programmers, but it can trip newer modders up\n- ChatGPT doesn't know anything, all it knows is placing one word in front of another based on the ongoing conversation. It doesn't know the meaning of words and it can't explain its thought process behind the code it's created\n\nChatGPT is a great tool for modding, it can help brainstorm or come up with names for things. It can even do some menial text parsing, if you're patient enough. However, it isn't suited for writing code, so please don't use it for that",
